restapi_sdk_dotnet
==================

.NET SDK for SecureNet PayOS REST API.  Web documentation can be located at http://apidocs.securenet.com/docs/getstarted.html

SecureNetRestApiSDK.sln is a Visual Studio 2013 solution file.  The solution contains a unit test project located in
SecureNetRestApiSDK_UnitTest and a core project located in SecureNetRestApiSDK.

After you have signed up for the sandbox at http://www.securenet.com/get-sandbox and you are ready to start running actual tests in the SDK, the App.config in the SecureNetRestApiSDK_UnitTest project will need to be modified to include your assigned secureNetId and secureKey.
